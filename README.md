### Hi there! 👋🏼

I'm Nicky, a full-stack software engineer.

- 🤖 I’m working at [thoughtful](https://www.thoughtful.ai/) to build the world's digital workforce
- 🌱 I’m learning **AWS**, **React**, and **TypeScript** these days
- ✏️ I post articles on my [blog](https://nickymarino.com) about software dev and more!
- 🔭 My current side project is [shorty](https://github.com/nickymarino.com/shorty), a URL shortener

I work mainly with TypeScript, Python, and AWS technologies. I know my way around React, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, and Git.
